# Sounds for the Deaf

## Introduction

For us, a movie can be an incredible experience. Watching everything happen on the big screen with all kinds of sound effects and beautiful dialog.
But for people who can't hear a thing, it can be really difficult to understand everything happening on
the screen. There are solutions to this, like simple subtitles, but this can be very boring.
It is up to us students of the minor *Visual Interface Design* to put some extra magic to the simple subtitles.

## The research for this project

At first I did some research to what is needed for deaf people to get the right feeling from a movie. I searched some documents conserning the rules and guidelines used for this kind of things. In order to make something unique, I wanted to do something that has not been done before. So looking at the guidelines, I could get an image of what to "ignore", deviate from what is convenient.

### Basic rules

One of the things found was that there is a correct *read speed*, a maximum of 2 lines per subtitle and every line can only have 40 characters. Next is the minimum duration of a subtitle (1 second) and the maximum duration (6 seconds).

### Colors

## Typography

The typography that is used for my subtitles comes from the *Brenner* family. I could have chosen a different font, but the Brenner font gives a lot of different styles to try out and see wich is best for wich voice. In the first part of the video, I use *Brenner slab* for 'voice 1'. This is because in this fragment, the one who is asking the questions sounds like a boss, a leader who decides what happens to the different people he chats with. That's why I chose to give him a strong, bold style of text. This way a deaf person will know that 'voice 1' is in charge and decides wheter *agent K* will get his bonus or not.
For *agent K* I've chosen to give him a skinnier, weaker text style. The agent is the one that's being questioned. The agent is the one they put in a white room with no chance to do anything but sit there. So he has to be obedient to his boss (or the one queestioning him). To make the text submissive, I made is skinnier than 'voice 1' and made is italic to make the difference between the two speaking voices clearer.

So, 'voice 1' who asks all the questions in the first fragment of the video gets *Brenner slab*, and the agent gets *Brenner sans*.
