# Sounds for the Deaf

## Introduction

For us, a movie can be an incredible experience. Watching everything happen on the big screen with all kinds of sound effects and beautiful dialog.
But for people who can't hear a thing, it can be really difficult to understand everything happening on
the screen. There are solutions to this, like simple subtitles, but this can be very boring.
It is up to us students of the minor *Visual Interface Design* to put some extra magic to the simple subtitles.

## The research for this project

At first I did some research to what is needed for deaf people to get the right feeling from a movie. I searched some documents conserning the rules and guidelines used for this kind of things. In order to make something unique, I wanted to do something that has not been done before. So looking at the guidelines, I could get an image of what to "ignore", deviate from what is convenient.

### Basic rules

Searching on the internet I found several [rules and guidelines](https://www.rev.com/blog/subtitles-blog/sdh-subtitles-for-the-deaf-and-hard-of-hearing) for subtitles for movies. Most of the rules are about the timing. When does a subtitle appear, when does is dissapear, how is it places on the screen? Most of these rules makes subtitles not that interesting. For this project, it is important to kind of ignore those rules and do something completly different.

What is being subtitled? Next to the voices of the actors, a lot of special effects are being subtitled as well. Think about and extremely huge explosion, underwater bubbles or anything relevant to know what is going on. But sounds not only make a movie spectaculair, they can also have the opposite effect. With sounds you can make a scene interesting, scary or you can build up a lot of tension. And that last one is compelling. Because in the first fragment of the video I'm working on, a high piched tone can be heard. This tone gets worse and worse when more questions follow and than suddenly... it stops. So it is important to give the same fealing to deaf people, to let them know that there is something irritating going on. For this, a simple subtitle won't be enough.

Next, you don't want to make subtitles inaccurate, gibberish or butchered. It has to be relevant to the scenes it's being used to. Seeing all the rules and guidelines for subtitles, I get a pretty good idea what to do different to make subtitles more interesting. So, in the next chapters I will explain what I did and most importantly why I did it.

### Colors

## Typography

The typography that is used for my subtitles comes from the *Brenner* family. I could have chosen a different font, but the Brenner font gives a lot of different styles to try out and see wich is best for wich voice. In the first part of the video, I use *Brenner slab* for 'voice 1'. This is because in this fragment, the one who is asking the questions sounds like a boss, a leader who decides what happens to the different people he chats with. That's why I chose to give him a strong, bold style of text. This way a deaf person will know that 'voice 1' is in charge and decides wheter *agent K* will get his bonus or not.
For *agent K* I've chosen to give him a skinnier, weaker text style. The agent is the one that's being questioned. The agent is the one they put in a white room with no chance to do anything but sit there. So he has to be obedient to his boss (or the one queestioning him). To make the text submissive, I made is skinnier than 'voice 1' and made is italic to make the difference between the two speaking voices clearer.

So, 'voice 1' who asks all the questions in the first fragment of the video gets *Brenner slab*, and the agent gets *Brenner sans*. To ake the difference bigger between the two voices, I made 'voice 2' italic, so it will be easier to understand that it is in fact the other person talking.⋅⋅
⋅⋅⋅The typography is used again in the second fragment of the entire video. Using the same typography again, the person who is wathcing will recognize this and will know wich voice is who.

## Nuances

## Different feedback

In the past two weeks of this project, I got several points of feedback on what I was making.
From other students, I got the ideas to listen more to *how* they say some words in the video. This way I can listen if any word is being said with any emotion. If so, I can change the typography, color or anything else to make a deaf person think 'hey, this is being said differently, is thas to be important'. Further more, don't do the convenient. Normally, you want to make these things as you know them yourself. But now we need to look at subtitles in a whole different way. And that is exactly what my teacher told me. Make it more extreme, more expressive, make it as weird as you want. But, watch out to not overdo it. And with the nuances and different words: listen to how they say it. In the first fragment, the person (or machine) asking the questions doesn't put much emotion in the sentences. But in the second fragment, for example 'love', the word is being sad with a sort of sadness. And that is exactly the emotion you want a deaf person to recieve while reading that subtitle.
